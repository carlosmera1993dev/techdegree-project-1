            <p>I was born by the river in a little tent
            Oh and just like the river I've been running ev'r since
            It's been a long time, a long time coming
            But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will</p>

            <p>It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
            'Cause I don't know what's up there, beyond the sky
            It's been a long, a long time coming
            But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will</p>

            <p>I go to the movie and I go downtown
            Somebody keep tellin' me don't hang around
            It's been a long, a long time coming
            But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will</p>

            <p>Then I go to my brother
            And I say brother help me please
            But he winds up knockin' me
            Back down on my knees, oh</p>

            <p>There have been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
            But now I think I'm able to carry on
            It's been a long, a long time coming
            But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will</p>
